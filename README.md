# CounterSplit

CounterSplit is a Windows Forms application designed to track in-game statistics for **God of War** speedruns. It provides real-time tracking of key metrics such as in-game time (IGT), hit counts, health points, and more. The application is tailored for speedrunners aiming for precision and performance in their runs.

## Features

- **Real-Time Tracking**: Displays in-game time (IGT), last recorded time (LRT), current health, total damage, and hit counts.
- **Segment Splits**: Automatically tracks and displays splits for different game segments.
- **Memory Integration**: Reads game data directly from PCSX2 emulator's memory for accurate tracking.
- **Customizable UI**: Minimalistic and user-friendly interface with drag-and-drop support.
